# Hi there, I'm Ian Heung. Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

### ⚛️ About Me
I am a postgraduate student based in London from Hong Kong. I went to university in the United States for 4 years at Davidson College, graduating in May 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Physics and computer science minor. During my time there, I participated in machine learning research for applications in nuclear physics experiments. I also participated in a research internship in Okinawa, Japan, where I designed a PID controller for a laser freqency control system.

I am now currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in the United Kingdom at University College London in the MSc. Scientific and Data Intensive Computing program. I am working on various data projects in my free time. Please check them out.

I am interested in the application of data and machine learning to generate insights and solve complex problems, whether that be in physics, sports, or finance.
