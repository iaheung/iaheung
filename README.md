# Hi there, I'm Ian Heung. Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

### ⚛️ About Me
I am a postgraduate student based in London from Hong Kong. I went to university in the United States for 4 years at Davidson College, graduating in May 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Physics and computer science minor. I am now currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in the United Kingdom at University College London in the MSc. Scientific and Data Intensive Computing program.

I am interested in the application of data and machine learning to generate insights and solve complex problems, whether that be in physics, sports, or finance.
