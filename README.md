# Hi there, I'm Ian Heung. Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

### ⚛️ About Me
I am a senior at Davidson College, majoring in physics and minoring in computer science. I am interested in the intersection of machine learning and physics, and am interested in applying machine learning beyond physics applications.
   
### 🔭 Research
- Here are machine learning projects I have worked on in my research:
   - [3D Sparse Convolutional Networks for Classification and Segmentation Tasks (Current)](https://github.com/iaheung/attpc-torchsparse.git)
   - [Identifying Isotopes with Machine Learning](https://github.com/iaheung/2D3DCNN_Event_Classification)
- I also interend at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, where I implemented a PID controller and digital filters onto an FPGA board with HDL coding
   - [Experimental Quantum Information Physics Unit Research](https://github.com/iaheung/oist_research/)
